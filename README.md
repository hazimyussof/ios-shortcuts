### [Smart Timer](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/18948/)

**Smart Timer** is an intuitive iOS shortcut app designed to simplify the way you manage your time, it extends the features of the default iOS timer. Inspired by the powerful timer functionalities found in the macOS app called ["Smart Countdown Timer" by FIPLAB](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-countdown-timer/id1410709951?mt=12), this Smart Timer iOS shortcut brings the same level of efficiency and convenience to your iPhone and iPad.

#### Features

- **Specific Time Calculation:** Input a specific time, and Smart Timer will accurately calculate and create a timer counting down to that exact moment. For example, if you input "15:00" or "3pm," the timer will be set to expire precisely at 15:00/3pm. _(This will work for both the 24-hour and 12-hour formats)_
- **Natural Language Input:** Set timers effortlessly by typing commands like "1h 30m 30s" or "1 hour 30 minutes 30 seconds." Smart Timer understands your input and translates it into precise timer settings. _(This will work with multiple combinations and sequences)_
